# MK8DEditor
This is an experimental Mario Kart 8 Deluxe plugin for [EditorCore](https://github.com/exelix11/EditorCore).
Refer to [EditorCore's readme](https://github.com/exelix11/EditorCore/blob/master/README.md) for the controls and other informations.
Note: this is a POC and hasn't been tested, also placeholder models are of the wrong size.

## Building
This is just the plugin, to build you need to download an EditorCore commit that matches the version you want to build (aka if you want to build the latest commit, latest EditorCore should work as they're often committed at the same time).

Download this repo, add it to the EditorCore solution and build.
